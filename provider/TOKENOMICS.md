# QUIVer Token Economics Model

## Executive Summary

QUIVer introduces a comprehensive token economics model designed to incentivize decentralized AI inference providers while ensuring quality, reliability, and sustainable growth. The QUIV token serves as the backbone of the ecosystem, facilitating payments, staking, governance, and quality assurance mechanisms.

## 1. Token Utility and Use Cases

### 1.1 Primary Utilities

#### Payment for Services
- **Inference Payments**: Consumers pay QUIV tokens for AI inference requests
- **Micropayments**: Support for streaming payments per token generated
- **Batch Processing**: Discounted rates for bulk inference requests

#### Staking and Collateral
- **Provider Staking**: Minimum stake required to join as a provider (initially 10,000 QUIV)
- **Performance Bonds**: Additional staking for priority listing and higher-tier models
- **Slashing Mechanism**: Stakes are slashed for poor performance or malicious behavior

#### Quality Assurance
- **Reputation Staking**: Providers can stake additional QUIV to boost reputation scores
- **Validator Rewards**: Token rewards for validators who verify inference quality
- **Challenge Mechanism**: Consumers can challenge results by staking QUIV

#### Governance
- **Protocol Upgrades**: Token holders vote on technical improvements
- **Parameter Adjustments**: Community-driven changes to fees, stakes, and rewards
- **Treasury Management**: Decisions on ecosystem fund allocation

### 1.2 Secondary Utilities

#### Data Marketplace
- **Model Trading**: Buy/sell access to fine-tuned models using QUIV
- **Dataset Licensing**: Exchange training data with QUIV payments
- **Compute Credits**: Pre-purchase inference capacity at discounted rates

#### Developer Ecosystem
